  description: >
    P03 §1.4.1 requires all source code changes to route through Tactical Domain
    via T04 prompt and AEL execution. No exemption exists for trivial, surgical
    fixes. In practice, Strategic Domain implements small changes directly,
    creating an undocumented protocol bypass. This change formalises a narrow
    exemption to align protocol with observed practice.

scope:
  summary: >
    Add §1.4.12 Trivial Change Exemption to P03. Define criteria permitting
    Strategic Domain to implement trivial, surgical source code changes
    directly after human approval, without raising T03/T02 documents,
    creating a T04 prompt, or invoking AEL. Git history serves as the audit
    record. Scope is deliberately narrow to preserve the standard workflow
    for all substantive changes.

rational:
  problem_statement: >
    P03 §1.4.1 requires T03, T02, T04, and AEL execution for all source
    code changes. No threshold exists below which this workflow may be
    bypassed. For trivial, surgical fixes this overhead is disproportionate
    and discourages protocol compliance for small work.
  proposed_solution: >
    A qualifying change must satisfy two definitions simultaneously:
    Trivial: the outcome is fully predictable before implementation; no
    analysis, experimentation, or design judgement is required to determine
    the correct solution. Surgical: confined to a single, well-bounded
    location in the codebase; does not disturb surrounding logic, interfaces,
    or dependent components. A change that is trivial but not surgical, or
    surgical but not trivial, does not qualify.

    Add §1.4.12 defining a Trivial Change Exemption: when a change satisfies
    both definitions AND all five criteria below, Strategic Domain may
    implement directly after human approval — no T03, T02, T04, or AEL
    required. Git commit history is the sole audit record for exempt changes.
    (1) confined to a single function or entry point;
    (2) net line delta ≤20 lines;
    (3) no interface changes (signatures, contracts, public APIs);
    (4) unambiguous with no design decisions required;
    (5) human approval obtained before implementation.
    All conditions must hold simultaneously. If any fails, standard
    T03 → T02 → T04 → AEL workflow applies.
  alternatives_considered:
    - option: "No exemption — enforce T04/AEL for all changes"
      reason_rejected: >
        Creates disproportionate overhead for trivial fixes. AEL execution
        for a 5-line argparse addition adds no quality benefit and discourages
        protocol compliance for small work.
    - option: "Line count threshold only (no other criteria)"
      reason_rejected: >
        Line count alone is insufficient. A small change can still introduce
        interface changes or require design decisions. All five criteria
        together define the true trivial boundary.
    - option: "Increase §1.4.11 scope to cover all src/ changes"
      reason_rejected: >
        §1.4.11 covers workspace/ documents only. Merging source and document
        exemptions would undermine the fundamental domain separation model.
  benefits:
    - "Eliminates compliance gap between observed practice and documented protocol"
    - "Reduces overhead for genuinely trivial surgical fixes"
    - "Preserves Tactical Domain authority for all substantive changes"
    - "Provides audit-defensible basis for direct Strategic Domain implementation"
  risks:
    - risk: "Criteria applied too loosely, allowing non-trivial changes to bypass AEL"
      mitigation: >
        All five criteria must hold simultaneously. The conjunction is
        deliberately strict. Human approval gate remains in place regardless.
    - risk: "Ambiguity in 'no interface changes' criterion"
      mitigation: >
        Criterion clarified as: no changes to function/method signatures,
        no changes to public API contracts, no changes to module-level
        constants used as external interfaces.

technical_details:
  current_behavior: >
    P03 §1.4.1 contains no exemption for trivial source changes. All
    source code modifications require T04 prompt creation and AEL execution.
    Strategic Domain implementing directly is an undocumented protocol bypass.
  proposed_behavior: >
    P03 §1.4.12 defines trivial and surgical change definitions plus five
    jointly-necessary criteria. When all are satisfied and human approval
    is obtained, Strategic Domain may implement directly — no T03, T02,
    T04, or AEL required. Git commit history is the sole audit record for
    exempt changes.
  implementation_approach: >
    Add §1.4.12 as a new numbered section immediately after §1.4.11 in
    governance.md (both framework/ and skel/ copies). Update version
    history. No other sections modified.

notes: >
  Origin: solax-modbus project, issue-c3f7a2e1 (emulator --port argument
  ignored). Strategic Domain implemented directly without T04/AEL, then
  identified the protocol gap and raised this change for the framework.
